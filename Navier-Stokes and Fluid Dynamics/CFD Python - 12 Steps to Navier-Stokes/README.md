# Physics-Simulations
This folder contains my solutions to Lorena A Barber's "12 Steps to Navier-Stokes". Each solution is generally explained, and code is altered for readability (functions, classes) from the examples given in the course.

The full course is available here: https://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/
